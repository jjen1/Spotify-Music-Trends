## Overview

Welcome to my mini project focused on analyzing music trends on Spotify for 2023! The main goal here is to identify the top artists, tracks, and albums using a dataset from Kaggle. This project has been a great way for me to practice my skills in data cleaning, management, and SQL querying, all while exploring the fascinating world of music trends.
