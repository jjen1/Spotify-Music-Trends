# Spotify 2023 Music Trends 
**Analyzing Top Artists, Tracks, and Albums Using SQL and PostgreSQL**

## Overview

This mini project explores music trends on Spotify in 2023 using a dataset from Kaggle. The primary objective is to identify the **top-performing artists, tracks, and albums**, while practicing core data skills such as data cleaning, relational modeling, and SQL querying.

Through structured exploration and analysis, the project also investigates correlations between track features (e.g., danceability, energy) and their popularity.

## Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle: [Spotify Dataset 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tonygordonjr/spotify-dataset-2023)
- The raw data was cleaned and transformed using Microsoft Excel.
- Cleaned `.csv` files were imported into a **PostgreSQL** database for querying, they're uploaded for convenience.

## Key Deliverables
- **SQL Scripts**:  
  - `sql_queries_1.sql`  
  - `sql_queries_2.sql`  
- **Results Workbook**:  
  - `spotify_results.xlsx` â€” contains the output of all major queries and visualizations.

## Label Analysis
  - What labels are associated with the most successful albums and singles?
